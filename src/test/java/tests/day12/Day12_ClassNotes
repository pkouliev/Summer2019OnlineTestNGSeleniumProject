GIT - is a version control tool

what does it mean version control?

In the simple words, git is a technology that helps you to track
changes in your project/code.

Git also help to collaborate.
Main version of the code resides in the remote repository.
In our case - GitHub.
Then anyone who wants to collaborate can get a copy of that project.

Git tacks changes and shows what and when was changed by whom.

Git vs GitHub?
Git - a VCS (Version Control System)  tool
GitHub - a storage tool for Git projects.
Github is like a smart google drive that targets git projects.

GitHub is not only one available solution.
There are other like BitBucket which also works with Git.
BitBucket is from same developers as a Jira.

How we can see history of changes in git project?

Check commits

Every commit it's like a snapshot, you want to do a
snapshot to capture changes.

class Person {
    int age;
}

commit1: "First commit"

class Person {
    int age;
    String name;
}

commit2: "Added string variable name"

class Person {
    int age;
    String name;
    String address;
}

commit3: "Added address variable"

Why do we keep project on github?
Because it's not secured to have only one place for saving.
It's more secured to have back up.
Also, github will help to collaborate multiple on the same project.

File --> new --> project

Select Maven project

Click next

Then create a class "Person"

Step 1. git init
Initialized empty git repository....

Step 2. Right click on the project and create .gitignore file.
This file will contain list of files/folders that shouldn't be committed.

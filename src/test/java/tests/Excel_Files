Operations with excel files:

To connect java code with excel files we use Apache POI library, means that it's free.
Since we cannot open excel file without special decoding, we have to use library that can do it for us.

#To open excel file, we need to do few things:
    - first of all, open file through FileInputStream
        FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("path/to/the/file.xlsx);

    - Then, we have to use workbook to create object of excel file.
        Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(fileInputStream);

        * Creates the appropriate HSSWorkbook / XSSWorkbook from the given fileInputStream

We use WorkbookFactory, because it can open both type of excel files .xls (old) and .xlsx (new).

    workbook = excel file

# Next step is to open spreadsheet, because excel file can have multiple spreadsheets.
    It's like book can have multiple pages.

Sheet workSheet = workbook.getSheet("name_off_sheet);

#Then, since excel file it's a table, and table consists of rows and cells, we need to open Row first.

Row row = workSheet.getRow(0);

#Every row consists of cells, to get data from row, we need to use Cell

Cell cell = row.getCell(1);

workbook -> worksheet -> row -> cell

In test automation, excel files are very popular for storing test data.
If we combine excel file with data provider we can do data driven testing.
To do so, we have to open some file, and return info as 2D array.

We use DataProvider only to execute same test many times with different data sets.

DataProvider is not required to use along with Apache POI.
It was our test case, that requires to login many times with different credentials.
As many rows in excel spreadsheet, as many times same test will be executed.

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Keys to send should be a not null CharSequence

If you are trying to read data from map, and key name is wrong, you will get null.

Then, if you are trying to use sendKeys() with null, you will get above exception.

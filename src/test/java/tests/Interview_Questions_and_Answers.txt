One of interview questions is:

Tell me about your framework?
- tools that I use
- design patterns (Page Object Model)
- packages that I have

Cucumber or Protractor or Appium as current project, I don't concentrate on TestNG framework.

How to create framework from scratch?
It's all about tools and design patterns that I want to apply.

Tools: Java, Maven, Selenium WebDriver
(for mobile it's appium, for angular applications use Protractor)

Design Patterns: Page Object Model, Singleton Driver

How do you report: as of now, I use extent report

What type of framework would you choose:
Data Driven + Page Object (Modular) = Hybrid framework.

To start:
- We create maven project
- then we create packages like: pages, tests, utilities, database
- add dependencies
- adding driver class, browser utils, config reader...
- add configuration.properties file
- create test base and page base classes
- create login page class
- create smoke test.xml file

Everything complex consists of simple things.
Don't be scared of big and complex frameworks.

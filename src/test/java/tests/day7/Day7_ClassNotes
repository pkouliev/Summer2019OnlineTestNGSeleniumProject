Warm up task:

Let's go to cybertekschool.com
And find number of links

findElement vs findElements

findElement = only 1 element
in case of findElement if there is no element found, there will be exception
NoSuchElementException

findElements = 0 or more elements
if findElements list is empty, that means there are no elements present
we can verify there are no elements

//a[.='text'] or //a[text()='text'] - find link with text name Home


CSS locator:

Syntax: [Attribute='Value']

1. index.html
2. style.css
3. function.js

css example:

input {
    font-family: Helvetica
    background-color: blue;
    margin: 0;
}

body {
    height: 100px;
    padding: 0;
}

Basic CSS selector:
tagName[attribute='value']
no //, no @

xpath would like:
//tagName[@attribute='value']

CSS # sign, locating by the value of ID
elementName#valueofAttribute
#valueofID
#id - means find element with id

also, it works like: [id='value']

For class name:

.className - means find element with class name
also works like this: [class='className']

if class name has a space, that means you need to put
. in between. Because, space in the class,
it's delimiter for different classes

[attribute='value'][attribute='value'] - to specify 2 attributes

contains in Css selector:
put * after attribute

[attribute*='value'] - value can be partial,
same like //*[contains(@attribute,'value')] in xpath

Css example: [id*='d'], means that some element contains d in the id value

to match beginning of the attribute value, we use caret: ^ symbol after attribute name.

Css: End of the attribute:
[attribute$='end_of_value'] - $ means attribute value's ending part

* - contains
^ - starts with
$ - ends with

Moving from parent to child element in Css selector:
"space" or ">"

Difference between space and > ?
space in between mean any child (can be grand, or grand grand child)
> means only direct child.

.value > tag - means find element with tag name, that has direct
parent with attribute value

parent > child

Only @Test annotation is required. Everything else is optional.

@BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod run always before and after every test.

@BeforeSuite runs as pre-condition for entire test suite. Test suite can include tests from multiple test classes.

@DataProvider helps to run same test with different sets of data.


<div>
    <input type="radio" name = "color">
    <label>Blue</label>
</div>

input and label are siblings.

//*[text()='Blue']/.. - to go to the parent element - div

//*[text()='Blue']/preceding-sibling::input - go to input,
    that is on top


//input[@type='radio']/following-sibling::label - go to label.
    that is on bottom.
